## 1️⃣ About C#

- **C# (C-Sharp)** is a modern, object-oriented programming language.
    
- Developed by Microsoft as part of the **.NET platform**.
    
- Designed to be:
    
    - Powerful 💪
        
    - Simple 🙂
        
    - Expressive ✨
        
- Used to build:
    
    - Desktop applications
        
    - Web applications
        
    - Mobile apps
        
    - Cloud services
        
    - Games (with Unity)
        
    - Enterprise software

## 2️⃣ What Makes C# Special?

### ✔️ Rich History

- Created in early 2000s.
    
- Designed by Anders Hejlsberg.
    
- Influenced by:
    
    - C
        
    - C++
        
    - Java
        

### ✔️ Expressive Syntax

- Code is clean and readable.
    
- Strong type system.
    
- Supports modern features like:
    
    - Properties
        
    - LINQ
        
    - Async/await
        
    - Lambda expressions
        

If you’re comfortable with Java, C# syntax will feel very familiar.

Example:

```csharp
int number = 10;
string name = "Kiran";
Console.WriteLine(name);
```

## 3️⃣ .NET Runtime

C# runs on the **.NET runtime**, which provides:

- Garbage collection (automatic memory management)
    
- Large standard library
    
- Security features
    
- Cross-platform support
    

👉 Earlier .NET was mostly Windows-based.  
👉 Now with **.NET Core / .NET 5+**, C# runs on:

- Windows
    
- Linux
    
- macOS

# 🧠 Extra Important Concepts (Added for You)

Since you're preparing for placements, let me expand a bit deeper.

---

## 🔸 1. Compilation Process in C#

C# code → Compiled into → **IL (Intermediate Language)**  
IL → Executed by → **CLR (Common Language Runtime)**

Flow:

```
C# Code → IL Code → CLR → Machine Code
```

CLR handles:

- Memory management
    
- Exception handling
    
- Security
    
- Thread management
    

---

## 🔸 2. Strongly Typed Language

In C#, every variable must have a type.

```csharp
int age = 21;
double salary = 50000.50;
bool isPlaced = true;
```

You cannot assign wrong types.

---

## 🔸 3. Object-Oriented Nature

C# is fully object-oriented.

Everything revolves around:

- Classes
    
- Objects
    
- Methods
    
- Properties
    

Example:

```csharp
class Student
{
    public string Name;
    public int Age;

    public void Display()
    {
        Console.WriteLine(Name);
    }
}
```

Very similar to Java — so your OOP confidence will help here.

## 🔸 4. Why Companies Use C#

- Enterprise applications (banks, corporate systems)
    
- Backend APIs (ASP.NET Core)
    
- Game development (Unity uses C#)
    
- Azure cloud services
    

Many big tech companies use C# in backend systems.
